Project update:
1- Make sure all your entities are thread-safe (support concurancy)
2- The Insurance company could be modified by other applications that are not JPA. Make sure your application can work with that.
3- Create a query that updates the DOB of a Person. This query is executed by several users of our application at the same time. 
This could result in issues, so make this query safe. The chances of collision when using this query are very high.
