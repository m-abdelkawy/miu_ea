Project Update:

1- Log to the console every time a Car is added to the database.

2- Log to the console every time a Person is deleted from the database.

3- Make sure the relationship between Person and Car is lazy. 
Then write two functions. The first function fetches a person with the name "Jack" (make sure you have a person with the name "Jack" in your database). 
The second function takes a person and returns all the cars this person drives (by just calling the getter (getCars) on Person). Now make sure this code works. 
Note, at first it should fail because when you enter the second function the person is detached since the first function commits the transaction at the end of it. 
You need to solve the problem by re-attaching the person to em.
